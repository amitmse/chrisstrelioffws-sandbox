Install sqlite3 on Ubuntu 14.04
===============================

The second assignment for `Coursera's Introduction to Data Science`_ focuses
on databases and relational algebra.  The programming assignments are done with
sqlite3, so I need to install it on my Ubuntu 14.04 machine.

Following a nice `sqlite tutorial at digitalocean`_, I'll install the
version in the Ubuntu repository using the typical commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev

At this point, we're ready to go with the assignment. For those that are
interested, the `sqlite tutorial at digitalocean`_ goes through simple examples
including creating a database and doing simple queries.
